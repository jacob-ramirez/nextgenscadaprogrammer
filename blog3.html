                    <h1 class="post-title">Computer Science Grad to SCADA Programmer</h1>	
                    <div class="entry">	
                        <p>I want to give some more background on myself from how I went from a computer science grad to SCADA programmer in the industrial automation world. Also, I want to give some insight to computer programmers about different industries they can excel in that aren’t some of the popular one (mobile apps, social media, etc.). </p>
                        <p>I am from a small town in west Texas in the heart of the oil patch. I was born and raised here. When I was picking my classes for my senior year and decided to pick a computer science class without knowing what I was getting myself into. </p>
                        
                        <p>In the beginner class we used different software to program Java. I thought that was the most interesting thing to see Hello World printed on the screen, which I bet that’s the case for a lot of computer programmers. Throughout the senior year we were pushed to figure out what we were going to do after high school and of course college was the direction presented most. </p>
                        
                        <p>After high school, I started out at a junior college and took all of my computer science courses at the university where I completed my bachelor’s in computer science. In several of the courses, teachers talked about how many jobs there were for computer programmers and jobs there would be in the future. As many of you know, there job market for computer programmers has grown and will continue to grow in the years to come. </p>
                        
                        <p>That all said, there isn’t much for positions for computer programmers in the heart of the oil patch. I had applied to several of the IT support jobs, knowing full well that I would need to learn a lot to do that type of job. After several months of not getting a computer programming job, I took a job at a local electrical contractor that my father in law was working at as a PLC programmer. My previous job before that was working at a parts store that took me 1 hour to get to.</p>
                        
                        <p>On my first day they enrolled me into a PLC programming class and learned the basics of ladder logic programming. It was a bit confusing since I learned programming in high level programming languages but I learned a lot. I didn’t get to program any PLCs during my time there but I did learn a lot about automation controls. This helped me get a position at my current company where I was one of 3 automation techs in the entire 5000+ employee company. </p>
                            
                        <p>This was the beginning of automation at my company and the person who hired me had to have a vision of the future of our company and how I could be an essential part of that. As the company grew we needed a way to monitor, control and collect data on all of our automated equipment. That is when our director of application development started looking for a SCADA solution for us. After looking at several different solutions we decided on Ignition, and we both are glad he did. </p>
                        
                        <p>We enrolled in the on site classes in 2018 to learn about the software. I had looked into other SCADA solutions myself and found that Ignition is very computer programmer friendly. I would also say that Ignition’s fast development environment is like having power tools in your computer programming toolset. </p>
                        
                        <p>I know that many computer programmers want to work at Google, Microsoft, etc., large tech related companies make mobile apps, any of the above, but the skills of a computer programmer can be utilized in the industrial automation world. </p>
                        
                        <p>I want this post and blog to enlighten computer programmers of the many possibilities of long-term and interesting work in other industries. </p>
                        
                        <p>I will be posting more blog posts about specific ways computer programmers that know Python, Java, Node.js, etc., can move into the industrial automation world. I hope this blog will open your mind to the other possibilities for a computer programmer. </p>
                        
                        <p>Until next time, continue coding. </p>
